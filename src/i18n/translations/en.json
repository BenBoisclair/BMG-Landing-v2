        "description": "Commissioned by a respected Thai monastery for their sister temple in the United States, this Enlightenment Buddha was sculpted to serve as the spiritual heart of Wat Nawamintararachutis in Taunton, Massachusetts — a temple built in honor of His Majesty King Rama IX. As Buddhism takes root abroad, this sacred figure offers a constant presence for those seeking stillness, prayer, and renewal.\n\nThe statue resides in the meditation hall on the second floor — a quiet, light-filled space designed for deep contemplation. Pilgrims and practitioners gather beneath this image not simply to observe it, but to be guided by it. Carved from fine Thassos white marble sourced from Greece, the stone was chosen for its crystal clarity and its capacity to reflect light with dignity. When sunlight moves through the room, the surface glows in silence — never imposing, always present.\n\nThe original artist appointed by the temple traveled from Thailand to our studio to oversee the final refinements. Working side-by-side with BMG's master-level artisans, every line, fold, and facial proportion was resolved with reverence. The final polish — full gloss across every surface — was applied with care to ensure purity, balance, and spiritual precision.\n\nToday, the Buddha anchors the meditation hall as a still guardian. It does not draw attention; it centers it. With each seated gathering, it offers clarity not through words, but through form — carved once, present always.",

Named Chedi Phra Thad Phut Tha Phucha, it was constructed to enshrine holy relics of the Buddha and his disciples, standing not only as a physical landmark but as a beacon of merit and collective devotion.\n\nThe structure is the largest known granite stupa in the Buddhist tradition. The largest stone block used measured 2.5 x 1.2 x 8.8 meters and weighed 105 tons — quarried and lifted with two forklifts working in precise harmony. Every piece was shaped by CNC-guided wire saw and then finished by hand. Our team worked in close collaboration with the monks at every stage, with many of us choosing to temporarily ordain during installation — an act of respect and shared spiritual intention.\n\nOnce the granite structure was completed, the entire body was clad in gold-finished stainless steel — a material chosen for its lasting brilliance and purity of presence. During the opening ceremony, over 250 monks gathered in unison with thousands of lay practitioners. The atmosphere was one of stillness and significance, a shared recognition that this chedi would outlast all who stood before it.\n\nToday, the stupa reflects not only light, but lineage — rising against the sky as a physical embodiment of devotion, community, and the noble path.",

Rather than referencing an existing depiction, the intention was to give form to an image held internally — one defined by feeling, balance, and presence.\n\nThe sculpture developed through careful interpretation. Proportion, posture, and expression were shaped gradually, guided by her original intent and refined as the form emerged. The process remained focused on clarity and alignment, allowing the sculpture to take shape without excess or deviation.\n\nThe completed work stands as a spiritual piece shaped by personal belief, where an internal vision was translated into a lasting form and allowed to remain quietly present.",

White Carrara marble was selected for its ability to hold softness and dignity, allowing the final work to convey warmth without excess.\n\nRather than capturing a single moment, the sculpture embodies collective remembrance.

        "description": "Commissioned by a revered waterworks patron and his Feng Shui master, this sacred sculpture serves not only as a water feature but as a symbolic convergence of flow, continuity, and grounded prosperity.\n\nA singular, oversized block of Thai granite — selected for both its geological resilience and harmonious grain — was sculpted into a continuous infinity loop to anchor the front court of the client's home. According to spiritual counsel, water was to pass through this form as a 'bridge of continuity,' ensuring wealth and energy would flow uninterrupted through the residence.\n\nThe form was resolved through multiple guided sessions with the patron and his spiritual advisor, each curve refined to exacting standards — down to a tolerance of 0.1 millimeters. This fidelity was achieved through a calibrated combination of CNC precision and artisan eye, ensuring that not a single gesture deviated from the original spiritual intent.\n\nFinal placement involved multi-tiered basin alignment to cradle the sculpture in concentric circles of water, echoing the continuous motion of the piece itself. Every line, polish, and plane was executed to instill presence without excess — a silent architecture of blessing and form.",

        "description": "For over two decades, the Grand Ubosot (main chapel) of Wat Sothorn Wararam Worawihan in Chachoengsao has stood as a testament not just to faith, but to a profound collaboration between spirit and artistry. This was not a mere construction project; it was a pilgrimage of dedication, culminating in a monument of national significance.\n\nAround 26 years ago, in an endeavor supported by His Majesty the King, the esteemed leadership of the temple sought to adorn the exterior and interior walls of the new Ubosot. The vision was massive, requiring a material worthy of its spiritual gravity — a material whose legacy transcended eras.\n\nThe choice was made: Statuario marble, sourced exclusively from the very Italian quarries that yielded the masterpieces of Michelangelo.\n\nThis commitment to perfection necessitated a journey. A monk and the project consultant traveled with our team to the ancient quarries of Italy. This was a mission of reverence: to personally hand-select each raw block of Statuario, ensuring that every slab destined for Wat Sothorn held the luminosity, purity, and character required for a place of such sanctity.\n\nThe marble, already immortalized by the Renaissance masters, found its new purpose in Thailand. It now serves as the permanent skin of the Grand Ubosot, its cool, luminous white and subtle grey veining reflecting the quiet clarity of devotion.",

        "description": "At Wat Arun, one of Thailand's most iconic temples, stood a collection of Chinese stone guardians dating back over 200 years — lions, door sentinels, and noble figures placed to protect sacred thresholds. Time had softened their edges and fractured their forms. The task was not to repair, but to resurrect — to protect the artist's original intent and allow the legacy to live forward without interruption.\n\nBMG approached this commission as a sacred responsibility. Using 3D scanning technology, we captured not only the broken fragments but the millimeter-precise soul of each figure. Every surface, curve, and texture was recorded in full fidelity. This raw data became the spiritual blueprint for renewal.\n\nEach form was re-sculpted from green marble — a dense, enduring stone chosen for both longevity and surface character. Using a 5-axis CNC system, we translated the scan into exact material dimensions. Then, with the original artifacts laid side by side, our artisans refined every contour by hand. Where the machine delivered structure, the human hand restored presence.\n\nFrom lions to Western-style gatekeepers, every element was matched — not copied, but continued. Each is now reborn not as a replica, but as an immutable extension of the original. This is not restoration. It is remembrance in form.",
