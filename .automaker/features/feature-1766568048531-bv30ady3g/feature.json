  "description": "Extract hardcoded color values and magic strings (e.g., #2C266C, #6b6b9d, #2d2d5a) into a centralized constants file. This makes the codebase easier to maintain and ensures consistent branding across components. Currently, colors are scattered throughout Astro components and CSS, making theme changes difficult.",
